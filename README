INTRODUCTION
------------
Many high performance computing application development tools have numerous common graphical user interface elements that are recreated for each tool.  The Parallel Tools GUI Framework (PTGF) provides these common elements, allowing tool developers to focus on adding real value to their projects instead of reinventing the wheel.

RELEASES
--------
If you need stable code, stick with the Master branch.  The devel branch is usually quite stable, and has the latest changes, but may be a bit more unstable.


INSTALLATION
------------
Build and installation instructions can be found in our GitHub Wiki <https://github.com/PTGF/PTGF/wiki>.
